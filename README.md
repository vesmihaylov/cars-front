# Used Car Deals Platform - FRONT END

This is the frontend side of the used car deals platform. It's built on top of **ReactJS** and Bootstrap. It only supports bulgarian localization for now. Dockerization is planned in the future for the [backend side](https://github.com/vesmihaylov/cars-back) and also the frontend side.
